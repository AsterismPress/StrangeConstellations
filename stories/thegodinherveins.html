Where you are going?&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Her Slavic boss asked from the office. The door was cracked open so he could call out to her without actually leaving the room. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nowhere.&rdquo; She looked around but the store was still deserted except for the two of them. &ldquo;Just going to face the jerky.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What if customer come and see you not behind cash?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CONSUME FLESH</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then they get upset and not come back,&rdquo; she mimed his accent as she grabbed a package of beef jerky.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Exactly.

It didn&#39;t seem to like salted meat, but at least she wasn&#39;t quite so hungry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The God in her veins promised power and wisdom, but </span><span class="c1">mostly It just</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;demanded meat. Her </span><span class="c1">memory</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of a life without It was cloudy&mdash;It still hadn&#39;t even fixed that&mdash;and she couldn&#39;t remember what it was like to be normal. She couldn&#39;t clearly remember more</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;than the past year,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;which</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;she had </span><span class="c1">spent listening to demands for meat while working at a convenience store.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had </span><span class="c1">vague memories</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of her past life but couldn&#39;t prove they weren&#39;t just television shows she&#39;d once watched. Had she actually driven around solving supernatural mysteries? Had her parents actually been killed in front of her? Were there actually aliens infiltrating world governments?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She didn&#39;t seem to have parents so the second seemed the most likely.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CONSUME FLESH</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A customer walked in. The older man, dressed like an anachronistic Texan rancher, gave a nod before making his way to the magazines. She nodded back, strumming her fingers on the counter. He was reading one without purchasing it, but Natt didn&#39;t care enough to stop him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">SPREAD ME</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she whispered. The man coughed and turned a page.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">SPREAD TO SURVIVE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was new.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">BLESS WITH BLOOD</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can&#39;t really do that in a store. My store. Where I work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">BLESS WITH BLOOD</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ugh, later.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">BLESS WITH BLOOD</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It had never </span><span class="c1">said this</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;before and she didn&#39;t know what it meant. The phrase felt intimate and messy, something she wasn&#39;t interested in performing on this strange man.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He coughed again, making her uneasy.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Weird sicknesses were popping up all the time. He eventually recovered enough to put back the magazine and grab a case of beer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CONSUME FLESH</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He looked through the chips, shaking his head at each one. Or perhaps just at each one&#39;s price. Natt clenched her fists. She wanted to hit something. She wanted to tackle someone and rip out their throat like a</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;lioness</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;hunting a gazelle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CONSUME FLESH</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He eventually came to the front, setting the beer down and looking pointedly at her nearly-flat chest.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Will that be all?&rdquo; she asked between gritted teeth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The end is comin&#39;, girl.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; She scanned the beer and gestured at the price on the screen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;None can be safe from the truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">SPREAD TO SURVIVE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He passed her a $20 bill and she gave him the change wordlessly. He nodded and left with his beer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What is your deal?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">SPREAD TO SURVIVE</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Give me something else. Words.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CONSUME FLESH.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She groaned and leaned against the back wall. It was another tedious hour before Cor came in for his shift. A few people came into the store. S</span><span class="c1">ome spoke meaningless pleasantries, some warned of a fast-approaching reckoning, and the rest bitched about prices.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Sprinkled against </span><span class="c1">th</span><span class="c1">is mosaic of </span><span class="c1">customer service</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;transactions were the God&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">demands</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for meat and blood rituals. It seemed keen on the idea without explaining any of the details.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Cor walked in the door she gave a dramatic bow. &ldquo;My savior.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What up, Natt, you&#39;re free. Be free.&rdquo; He swayed behind the counter and leaned against the back wall. He wore prescription sunglasses and had the </span><span class="c1">complexion of a teenage vampire.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;He was somewhere between ironically awful at life and just regular awful at life, and Natt could never say which parts of him were from which half.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Corvin, is you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m here, boss. The business is saved!&rdquo; He gave her a ragged smile and she thought he rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Anything exciting?&rdquo; He mumbled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nope. Literally nothing. Oh, wait, no, there are some creeps in town who are talking about the truth coming for us. Or the apocalypse. Or something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He snorted. &ldquo;Yeah, got that yesterday. Weird religious freaks, although I didn&#39;t see any crosses on &#39;em or anything. Must be some convention in town.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In </span><span class="c0">this</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;town?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who knows? Maybe we missed an alien landing and they&#39;re alien nerds. Or they&#39;re aliens.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CONSUME FLESH</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her stomach growled and Natt said, &ldquo;I&#39;m sure we can get to the bottom of this but I&#39;m starved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&#39;ll update you if any aliens come lookin&#39; for booze.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks. I&#39;m going for break!&rdquo; She called back and got a garbled phrase that was presumably an acknowledgment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She waved at Cor and walked up the street to a chip stand. The streets were as dead as usual, although the people she did notice seemed strange. She couldn&#39;t decide if she just didn&#39;t know her neighbors, or if they were from out of town.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">FLESH</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m on it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She bought a triple burger with bacon and the God in her veins seemed appeased. She felt rather than heard a contented vibration, rather like a cat&#39;s purr. As she finished the burger and started appreciating the beautiful day in relative silence, she decided to try asking it, </span><span class="c0">How do I bless with blood?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">FIND A HOST AND JOIN THE HOST TO US</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">FIND A HOST</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What sort of host?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">UNINFECTED BY METAL, TREES, OR LIES</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t understand any of that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CONSUME FLESH</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I literally just did!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CONSUME FLESH</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Natt got back up and threw out her garbage. Across the street was a small bookshop she liked to browse, but first she pulled out a pocket mirror and made sure her face was clean and as pretty as it could get. She </span><span class="c1">didn&#39;t care</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;enough to put on </span><span class="c1">makeup</span><span class="c1">, so she shrugged and decided she was &ldquo;as good as it gets&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As she entered, a bell above the door announced her arrival. Rose peeked out from behind a shelf, smiled, and vanished again. Her hair was dyed a lovely purple that matched her purple lace collar. Her face was strangely familiar yet utterly unplaceable; Natt had never gotten the courage to ask if they&#39;d met somewhere else, but the other woman had never acted as if they had.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Violin music played from a speaker in the front and the place was empty except for them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Busy day?&rdquo; Natt asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Busy as ever. I think sales burst into the double digits today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Natt looked at the nearest shelf, barely reading the titles. She always left with a romance novel, something she could read in a night. But she still liked the look and smell of all these old books living together, and the covers of things she&#39;d never heard of and would likely never read.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you end up seeing that frog exhibit?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rose reappeared from behind the shelf, one arm full of books. &ldquo;Yeah, it was pretty good. Worth seeing once, certainly. You should check it out before it leaves town.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, maybe.&rdquo; She picked up a book and had to grin at the cover. A dreadful fantasy book featuring the titled hero Baron Knight as he fought off monsters and won the affection of some swooning maiden who was... from the future?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&#39;re actually all right,&rdquo; Rose said, nodding at it. &ldquo;If you can get past some groan-worthy male power-fantasy crap and the occasional explosion of flowery prose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m not sure I could get past that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, not for everyone. There&#39;s a romance between him and the girl, though.&rdquo; She wiggled her eyebrows and Natt blushed, looking back to the cover.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, but it&#39;s hardly the focus, is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">BLESS WITH BLOOD</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, not really. It&#39;s pretty forced.&rdquo; She placed books on the shelves to either side of them and Natt swallowed, trying to moisten her suddenly-dry mouth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, are you... doing anything tonight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dinner with my sister.&rdquo; She frowned, but didn&#39;t look up from the books. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, ah, no reason. So you recommend this book, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A smile. &ldquo;Yeah. It&#39;s that &lsquo;so bad it&#39;s good&rsquo; sort of thing. Lots of neat concepts, though, particularly the demonology.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&#39;ll see if Baron Knight is all he&#39;s cracked up to be then.&rdquo; She held up the book as Rose placed her last one down.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just a dollar for this piece of art.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Natt pulled out a pile of coins and handed her 4 quarters, smiling apologetically. &ldquo;I&#39;ll tell you how it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You better!&rdquo; The other woman disappeared into the back and Natt left with a sigh.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">BLESS WITH BLOOD</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m trying to get someone, but I&#39;m... not very good at it.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">Or a lot of things, </span><span class="c1">she thought.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She returned to work 5 minutes early. Cor looked as if he hadn&#39;t so much as moved except to grab a magazine. Something about scandals and famous people.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What up, Cor,&rdquo; she said, swaying like a flamboyant drunk. He waved a hand dismissively.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Boss is gone, so I&#39;ve just been here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Any more freaks?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Naw. Well, nobody strange in the strange sort of way at least. Just the usual sort of hicks and yuppies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">BLESS WITH BLOOD</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She grimaced. Cor was in the uncanny valley of intimacy, neither a stranger nor someone with whom she shared any real spiritual connection. To do something involving bodily fluids, she felt that it had to be on either end of the spectrum or it would just be </span><span class="c0">weird.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Still, he did seem to meet a lot of people...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You going out tonight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; he said, looking taken aback. &ldquo;Are you thinking of actually doing something outside work and home?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up, and yes. Where are you going tonight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m going down to the harbour.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Harbour? Ugh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fine, don&#39;t come.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, just... the harbour?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, cheap bars, cheap drinks, cheap people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, fine. I&#39;m in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sweet. I&#39;m off at 4 and going down at 5.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t... that early?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Natt, please, trust me. You want to get a head start on these things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He nodded at the book she still had in her hands and asked, &ldquo;You&#39;re reading Baron Knight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just bought it. Is it any good?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&#39;s the greatest and stupidest work of our times. Neat magic mechanics, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, Rose was saying something like that&mdash;she&#39;s the girl who works at the book store. She mentioned the demonology.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Almost believable, you know? If it isn&#39;t aliens in the government, it must be some sort of gooey demons that possess wolves and bears and stuff.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How would wolves and bears infiltrate government?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By switching hosts, obviously.&rdquo; He gave her what was probably a pointed look, but with his glasses on it was largely lost on her. With a shrug, he picked up his magazine and kept reading.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She looked at the book in her hands and frowned. It completely transected her limited social life and it made her uncomfortable, like she had something gross on her face and no one was telling her. Determined to join whatever skeezy club Baron Knight readers enjoyed, she cracked open the book and read.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Baron Knight was responding to rumours of monsters in rural France&mdash;evidently he was some sort of expert on monsters. Before the first chapter ended he was surrounded by five demonic wolves, which he would dispatch with his bare hands by the middle of chapter two. He made atrocious puns the wolves didn&#39;t seem to appreciate and which flew above the heads of the dim-witted villagers he would </span><span class="c1">later rescue</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from similarly unnatural wolves.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The characters were shallow and the plot poorly planned, but the world seemed eerily real. Cor and Natt alternated serving customers and she managed to burn through a good quarter of the book before her shift ended. Baton Knight was on his way to investigate a mysterious cult outside the village and she was on her way to go lie on a couch for 3 hours.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How dressed up should I be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m going to wear a band shirt and jeans.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see. I&#39;ll work from that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See you at 5.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When she got in the door she stripped down to shower, even though work had not been particularly strenuous. She put on a purple dress she never got to wear&mdash;simple but pretty, and perfectly casual or semi-formal as the situation demanded.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Natt didn&#39;t want to bother with make up and her hair dried straight, just the way she liked. She would have preferred curls, but not enough to justify the effort. Instead she could look at short curly hair like Rose&#39;s and appreciate it vicariously..</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Left to her own devices, she collapsed on her couch and read.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Baron Knight reached the cultists, the head cultist accused him of standing in the way of progress.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No progress can be made while you&#39;re so blatantly infected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Infected by what?&rdquo; The cultist asked, as if humouring a child.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Baron Knight pointed at the glowing trunk in the middle of their cave, massive, ancient, and emitting demonic magic.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Infected by the Tree.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Natt shut the book and tossed it away. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Infected by the Tree</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The God in her veins was silent now, not offering any connection between Itself and this trashy piece of fiction. Or quasi-fiction, at least.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She checked her phone for the time and decided to go for it. Flats on feet, book in purse, she darted out the door.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was 15 minutes either way and she debated whom she&#39;d visit. Cor had known about the books, but if their boss was back they could hardly talk about them until he was off, which wasn&#39;t for another two hours.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So as she stepped into the bookshop she was relieved to find it empty as ever.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Back again?&rdquo; Rose asked, looking up from an open book on her counter. &ldquo;How was it?&rdquo; She looked over Natt&#39;s dress with approval.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Natt blushed and said, &ldquo;I haven&#39;t finished yet.&rdquo; She walked up to the counter and tried to remember her plan of attack but Rose&#39;s eyes, familiar but all the wrong colour, made her forget everything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, pity. Good so far, though?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. Tacky, but good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That about sums it up. Where are you at?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, he&#39;s at the cultists in that cave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yeah. That fight is absurd.&rdquo; She smiled and Natt tried to smile back, but the other girl&#39;s lips curved with ease and her eyes glittered with something bordering magic. And Natt... well, she couldn&#39;t see herself but she imagined she was basically the antithesis of visual charm.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen, you know that bit where he says, &lsquo;you&#39;re infected by the Tree&rsquo;, does he ever mention... other kinds of infections?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rose asked slowly, &ldquo;Like what other kinds?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, like... Metal. Or Lies. &lsquo;Infected by Lies&rsquo; or something like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Any others?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She looked at the ceiling. &ldquo;No? Just those three. Trees, Lies, Metal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CORRUPT AND DESTROY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Natt shook, the voice a rattling command in the centre of her head. Rose stepped around the counter and touched her arm. Her hand felt cool and calming, and for a moment her head was clear and her own. But she couldn&#39;t recall a thing before the hot, damp of the God returned to her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How did you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re well,&rdquo; Rose said, walking off to the front door. Natt raised a hand after her, the voice in her head returning in full force.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CORRUPT AND DESTROY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I have teas at my place that might make you feel better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her heart skipped and Natt couldn&#39;t speak.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was just about to close anyways.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your sister,&rdquo; she managed. Her voice was a croak, her blood was rushing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, don&#39;t worry, I can see her another day. She&#39;ll understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rose locked the door and flipped the OPEN sign to CLOSED. She returned and grabbed her by the hand, filling her again with a sort of inner peace.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(corrupt and destroy)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The voice was barely an echo, no life-altering presence but a mere nuisance to be dealt with in good time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just out the back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lead on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(corrupt and destroy)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rose kept hold of her hand and the voice remained partially muted, if not gone entirely. Her home was nearby, a cute cottage-like thing surrounded by plants and dominated by a large ash tree in the front yard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You live on your own?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How&mdash;&rdquo; She wanted to ask how she could afford this home and the shop, but it seemed rude. &ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About 9 years now. Time really flies, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Natt looked at the tree as Rose fished for keys. Had the tree in the cultist&#39;s cave been an ash? She couldn&#39;t remember, but it didn&#39;t seem </span><span class="c0">wrong</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Forgive the mess,&rdquo; she said, ushering her guest past piles of books into the kitchen which was in a similar state. The whole thing seemed an extension of her store if it had been overrun by potted and hanging plants. &ldquo;I love your dress, by the way. It makes you look so pretty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, thanks,&rdquo; she mumbled. Rose sat her down at a wooden table with 3 wooden chairs. She filled an electric kettle and plugged it in. One cupboard was full of teas and she pulled out two bags full of purple crystals the colour of Natt&#39;s dress and the colour of Rose&#39;s hair.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, we match,&rdquo; she said, instantly hating herself for her own inanity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But Rose gave a small laugh. &ldquo;It really is my favourite colour.&rdquo; She sat down and folded her hands in front of her. &ldquo;So.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How long have you been hearing voices?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh! What? I never&mdash;&rdquo; Rose held up a hand and shook her head.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&#39;s be honest. You&#39;ve got some sort of fluid parasite in you making weird requests, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. Yes I do.&rdquo; She narrowed her eyes, but Rose simply smiled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CORRUPT AND DESTROY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rose wasn&#39;t angry or frightened or even particularly concerned. This was just an everyday thing, apparently, having a God in your veins. She took in a deep breath and let it out. It felt like an absurd burden was being peeled off of her back. She could get back to normal, whatever that was. </span><span class="c0">She could accept this. She could accept me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CORRUPT AND DESTROY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&#39;t remember how long I&#39;ve been stuck with this... do you know how to make it better?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just a cup of tea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you have this too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, no, I&#39;ve just been told about it. I&#39;ve seen the other infections though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The kettle began to whistle and Rose unplugged it, pouring it into two mugs. She plopped a bag into each and belatedly asked, &ldquo;Oh, sorry, do you want milk or sugar?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, no, thanks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">DO NOT CONSUME</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It doesn&#39;t want me drinking this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rose set the mug in front of her and grabbed her hand. &ldquo;Well of course it doesn&#39;t. It will kill the creature inside you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(do not consume do not consume do not consume)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The voice was a murmur, insistent but distant like a television on in another room. Natt looked at the drink and sighed. This is what she wanted, right? To be normal?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(do not consume do not consume do not consume)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What had It actually done for her? Nothing. It made promises, sure, but would it actually fulfil them? Was it even capable of that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can It... actually give me super strength and stuff?&rdquo; she asked, feeling stupid for bothering. The steaming water in front of her turned a purple so dark it was almost black. It made her think of the stretch of sky just before night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The other girl sighed. &ldquo;I won&#39;t lie. There are stories that it can be done, although I&#39;ve never seen it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(do not consume do not consume do not consume)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rose ran her hand up and down Natt&#39;s arm.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&#39;re... making the voice quieter. How do you do that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m a servant of the Trees.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She pulled back her arm. &ldquo;Infected by the Trees, you mean.&rdquo; She shook her head. Why did she think that? All she knew about it was from a poorly written book.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">CORRUPT DESTROY CORRUPT DESTROY</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Trees don&#39;t live inside us, and They don&#39;t change who we are or make demands of us. We wilfully enter Their service, and They share Their gifts with us.&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rose shifted her chair closer until it was next to hers, and leaned in. &ldquo;You&#39;re sick but together we can make you better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rose reached for her hand slowly, looking for permission. Natt nodded and held out her hand. The other girl took it and raised it to her lips, kissing it. It was a gentle, nurturing kiss that made her shiver.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can... can we keep this up? After?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can stay here forever.&rdquo; Rose kissed her hand again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(do not consume)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The voice was the rustle of leaves in a forest, impotent and inconsequential. The tea was warm, strangely viscous and smelled of something sweet and metallic.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is all it takes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Natt raised her mug and looked expectantly at Rose. She shook her head but raised the mug. &ldquo;To new beginnings.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To new beginnings.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rose sipped her drink and Natt followed suit. Her stomach grumbled but Rose told her it was part of the process. She nodded.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So what is It called? The Thing inside me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A parasite. Specifically, it&#39;s &lsquo;Ooze&rsquo;. A silly name, I know, but when It&#39;s without a host It rather looks like... well, oozing gunk, really.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&#39;s the end of the pattern then? Metal, Trees, Lies, and Ooze?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, no. &lsquo;Blood&rsquo; is the word most often used. People tend to avoid using Their actual names.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Natt drank from her mug and grimaced. The sweetness left an aftertaste of decay, and in the back of her head something was crying out in anger. The word &lsquo;Blood&rsquo; seemed ominous as her entire body began to burn like a furnace. The God in her veins made her feverish on the best of days, but this was a shamanistic sweat that was simultaneously threatening and liberating.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The tree outside tapped on the window. It seemed to mock her even as the God in her veins screamed. But Rose squeezed her hand and refused to let go. Natt closed her eyes. She pictured a life with this girl. Helping others who found themselves cursed. She downed the last of her tea and coughed. Her mouth was dry and her insides felt like dust.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How... how long?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Moments, now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Natt tried to breathe but her lungs wouldn&#39;t respond. She wheezed and collapsed to the ground. Her right hand hung above her, still held tight by Rose.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry it has to be this way,&rdquo; she said. Her eyes were damp, tears dripping down her cheeks onto Natt&#39;s face. Natt struggled feebly, but as her chest got tighter she eventually gave up.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The dust in the tea kills the parasite, but not before It wrecks your insides. It doesn&#39;t seem to go without a fight, and it&#39;s the fight that kills you in the end. I&#39;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The God in Natt&#39;s veins had promised her all manner of things, but all</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;it had given her was death</span><span class="c1">. She outlived the parasite by seconds, but that was enough. Her spirit was saved, and would be offered to the Trees where she would be at rest.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rose finally released Natt&#39;s hand, letting it fall to the floor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Trees took one of many forms in her front yard, and It seemed to beckon infected to this town without a conscious understanding of why. Rose could never be sure when another would come her way, but she&#39;d been given enough poisons to last a lifetime, surely.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Most infected had to be tricked or forced into parting with their parasites</span><span class="c1">, but Natt had come for answers and </span><span class="c1">taken her cure</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;willingly. Rose was sorry for the girl&rsquo;s death, but there was nothing to be done for it now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In her well-sheltered backyard where ash roots still reached, four graves held the bodies of four infected. Three infected by Lies, one infected by Metal, and now she&#39;d need a fifth hole for one infected by Blood. </span><span class="c1">They would have said Rose was infected by Trees, </span><span class="c1">but </span><span class="c1">they didn&rsquo;t understand</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the true order of things. The Trees stood between humanity and infection.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The God in Natt&#39;s veins was no match for the God in Rose&#39;s yard.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
